# TaikyokuShogi

Implement of Taikyoku Shogi, a shogi game played on a 36x36 board

## How to play?

I'm currently in my way of coding the game, mainly adding all the pieces and their movements (which is a massive pain because of how many there are), I'll release an online version as soon as I can!

## Notes

Rules of the implementation taken from the [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taikyoku_shogi#Individual_pieces), when Wikipedia have two possible entries, I'm taking the Japanese Wikipedia as a reference

I'm also not a pro of sh≈çgi, so even if I did my best to reproduce everything as it should be, there may be some mistakes of interpretation or just some copy errors, take everything with a grain of salt!
